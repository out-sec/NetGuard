# NetGuard

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

NetGuard is a high-performance Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) implemented in modern C++ with CMake. It provides real-time network traffic analysis, multi-layer protocol parsing, custom rule-based detection, and a threat alerting system. Designed for extensibility, NetGuard aims to evolve into a Network Intrusion Prevention System (NIPS) with active mitigation capabilities.

## Features

### Core Capabilities
- **Packet Processing**:
  - Ethernet frame parsing
  - IPv4 and IPv6 support
  - TCP, UDP, and ICMP analysis
  - HTTP header inspection
- **Detection Engine**:
  - Signature-based detection
  - Protocol anomaly detection
  - Stateful pattern matching
  - Custom rule support
- **Performance**:
  - Multi-threaded processing
  - Zero-copy parsing
  - Rule optimization

### Supported Protocols
- Ethernet
- IP (v4 and v6)
- TCP
- UDP
- ICMP
- HTTP

### Future Protocol Support
To enhance detection capabilities, we plan to add support for the following protocols:
- [ ] DNS
- [ ] FTP
- [ ] SMTP
- [ ] SSH
- [ ] TLS/SSL
- [ ] SMB
- [ ] RDP

## Dependencies
- C++17 compiler (e.g., GCC 9+, Clang 10+, MSVC 2019+)
- CMake 3.14+
- libpcap 1.9.0+ (for Linux/macOS) or npcap (for Windows)

## Installation

### Linux/macOS
1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   sudo apt-get install libpcap-dev cmake g++
   ```
2. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/out-sec/NetGuard.git
   cd NetGuard
   ```
3. Build the project:
   ```
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
   make -j$(nproc)
   ```

### Windows
1. Install npcap from [https://npcap.com](https://npcap.com)
2. Install CMake from [https://cmake.org/download/](https://cmake.org/download/)
3. Install a C++ compiler (e.g., Visual Studio 2019+ with C++ tools)
4. Clone the repository and build using CMake GUI or command line.

## Usage
1. **Configure the Network Interface**:
   Edit `config/interface.cfg` to specify the network interface to monitor (e.g., `eth0`).
2. **Define Detection Rules**:
   Create or modify rule files in `rules/protocols/` or `rules/exploits/`. Refer to [Rule Syntax Guide](docs/rule_syntax.md) for details.
3. **Run NetGuard**:
   ```
   sudo ./build/netguard
   ```
   Note: Running as root is required to capture packets.
