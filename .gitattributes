# Markdown files
# Set the language for Markdown files to be detected by linguist
*.md linguist-language=Markdown
# Ensure Markdown files are detectable and not treated as documentation
# This prevents them from being excluded from language statistics
# and ensures they are counted in the language breakdown
# This is useful for projects where Markdown files are significant
# but not necessarily documentation (e.g., README files, notes)
# This setting can help in accurately reflecting the project's language usage
# in the GitHub language statistics.
# It is particularly useful for projects that have a lot of Markdown files
# that are not purely documentation, such as technical notes or project logs.
# The `linguist-detectable` setting ensures that these files are included
# in the language statistics, while `linguist-documentation` set to false
# ensures they are not treated as documentation files.
# This is useful for projects where Markdown files are significant  
*.md linguist-detectable=true
